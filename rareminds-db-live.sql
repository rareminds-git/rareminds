By providing employees with POSH training, organizations fulfill their legal obligations and demonstrate their commitment to creating a harassment-free workplace. Compliance with the law is not only essential for organizational reputation but also for mitigating legal risks and potential liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Preventing Potential Consequences:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment incidents can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. By investing in POSH training, organizations proactively prevent such incidents from occurring.

These investments ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of skill development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Dropout Rate Analysis:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dropout rate at the secondary level has come down to 1.5% in the latest report compared to 1.8% in the 3 academic year. However, certain states still have a higher dropout rate. For instance, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Jharkhand have dropout rates higher than the national average. In West Bengal, more than 15% of districts have a dropout rate exceeding 15% at the secondary school level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Companies Hiring 10th Pass Candidates:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading companies embracing 10th pass candidates include Tata Motors, Reliance Retail, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Flipkart, Big Bazaar, Bharti Airtel, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, and LIC. These companies offer a wide range of job opportunities such as retail sales associates, customer service representatives, delivery associates, warehouse associates, field operators, technicians, insurance agents, sales representatives, trade apprentices, and office attendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2955&quot; src=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neon-Yellow-Photocentric-Blogger-Bio-Link-Website-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;School dropout students&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neon-Yellow-Photocentric-Blogger-Bio-Link-Website-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neon-Yellow-Photocentric-Blogger-Bio-Link-Website-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neon-Yellow-Photocentric-Blogger-Bio-Link-Website-768x432.jpg 768w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neon-Yellow-Photocentric-Blogger-Bio-Link-Website.jpg 1366w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Programs Supporting Candidates:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skill development initiatives like Skill India and job placement services such as the National Career Service offer specialized training, career counseling&lt;mark class=&quot;has-inline-color has-black-color&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mark&gt; and job search support for 10th pass candidates. These programs aim to enhance employability and facilitate meaningful career paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Effectiveness and Results:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These programs enhance employability, increase job placements, and contribute to socioeconomic development.

Many researchers and scientists have published their studies with appropriate proofs that state how pursuing art decreases anxiety, depression, and other health-related issues. One of the studies talks about how people making art got their cortisol levels lowered till the time they were involved in the creative job, irrespective of how good or bad the artists were. The cortisol hormone plays an important role to help the body respond to stress. Pursing art has so far been successful in maintaining the right balance between too high and too low cortisol levels, as the extremes are equally dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There some magical benefits of pursuing Art mentioned below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;wp-block-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heals emotional injuries:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional injury is that traumatic situation where a person is constantly worried about something and has got trapped by a deep-rooted depression. People suffering from an emotional injury are often overlooked as most of them donundefinedt reflect any symptoms, they might behave as normal as any other person but are bleeding inside. They need special care and distraction from the worries on which they spend most of their time thinking about. Art being the perfect healer keeps a person occupied, decreases the cortisol level, and releases dopamine. These brain chemicals help regulate the mood of a person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased understanding of oneself:&lt;/strong&gt; Art helps us dive deep into our souls and know about the feelings, thoughts, perceptions, strengths, weaknesses, etc. that we have kept within us. A good communicator needs to first know about oneself in order to express in the best possible way. We can say that our soul and body are misaligned unless and until we donundefinedt bridge the gaps between them and create a healthy bond between the two. So a person who pursues art naturally becomes a good communicator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developed capacity for self-reflection:&lt;/strong&gt; Art is also a tool to assess yourself, your ways of working and responding to situations. We all want to keep pace with this fast-evolving world and hardly get time to stop and introspect ourselves. If we continue to move ahead without self-reflection for a longer time, we lose connection with the inner growing self. We only then know the surface-level aspects but a lot more lies within.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce symptoms for most of the diseases:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies have shown that patients of some deadly diseases have also been recovered when provided art therapy. Well, it will be wrong to say that only art can heal a patient completely as other medical treatments are imperative but art therapy are definitely an auxiliary when it comes to treating patients and now being practiced widely by professionals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in behaviors and thinking patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Art changes a personundefineds outlook and perception towards the world.

According to NSSO, Active Health Workersundefined density of nurses is estimated to be 10.6. The number drops to 6.0, after accounting for the adequate qualifications. This estimate is well below the WHO threshold of 44.5 nurses per 10,000 population. The already poor situation is further exacerbated by the 40%-60% attrition rate in the Nursing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, Nurse Attraction and Retention has become one of the foremost agenda of the Healthcare Talent Management Strategists. Rareminds has curated some of the core focus points that HRs should regularly revisit to ensure that they recruit high-quality nursing talent and reduce staff nurse vacancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A Solid Recruitment Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful retention starts when the right talent is hired in the first place. Skills and Clinical Practice Knowledge can be refined over time, but Behavioural attributes such as empathy, openness and a strong sense of responsibility towards patient requires an inward base. The recruitment process should be able to assess attributes that will help the Hospital achieve its long-term goals. Donundefinedt just fit the position with warm bodies. This also aids to avoid dropout of top performing nurses due to ineffective colleagues. Also, focus on the other end of the spectrum and start engaging the job seekers from the first touch. Donundefinedt just throw light of undefinedWhatundefined of the role but also on undefinedWhyundefined your&lt;br&gt;organization is the best fit. Be Employee Centric from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Develop a Nurse Residency Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in the Training and Skill refinement of your Nurses. You donundefinedt build a House without its Foundation, and You donundefinedt Build a Hospitals without its Nurses. Hence, as a Medical Institution, it is of prime importance that you invest time in providing support, feedback, mentoring to your nurses for their career advancement and growth. Provide them chances to explore different avenues within nursing. Allow them opportunities in specialized roles such as Neonatal ICU nurse. It not only helps to circumvent any monotony the staff may feel. But, more importantly, it raises the competency level of the entire unit, allowing them to fill in and support their colleagues during personal exigency. A robust cohesive nursing team also improves the patient care of the Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Offer Flexible Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nursing profession is physically and emotionally taxing. A study reflected that nurses typically work 12 hours a shift and 40 hours a week. These timings are a significant contributor to their stress, making them prone to turnover and job dissatisfaction. Experimenting with flexible scheduling has found to have a positive impact on their psyche. Providing various shit choices helps them have more control to foster a balance in their personal and professional lives. The collaborative Staffing Model that allows the nurses to work together to fill shifts in the West has shown to have a positive impact on work efficiency. Career Breaks and Sabbaticals have also proven to be significant in high performing talents to return with greater loyalty towards the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Recognize and Reward High Performers: Create Nurse Ambassadors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appreciation programs for the Nurses could just be the masterstroke of your Corporate Branding. I helps to acknowledge their dedication towards the patients and makes them feel like a valuable member of the organization. Many hospitals have awards like- undefinedNurse of the Monthundefined that help nurses become the Nursing Ambassadors. These institutes actively ask for their nurseundefineds opinions and thoughts on improving patient care. Inputs received are crucial since they spend more time with the patients than the doctors and the management. Also, circulating the views of the Ambassadors on various social media platforms helps with the engagement of the company with the job seekers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Hold Retention Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely important for the organizations to recognize what they are weak in but equally important to realize what they are doing right and how can they further strengthen it. Retention Interviews are an excellent way to understand why long-term senior nurses have stayed with the organizations. These testimonials, memories and reasons that comes up in the interview, work as two-fold inspiration. One it motivates the existing workforce to stay with the organization and second, it inspires new talents to become part of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remedy for the corporates to the nursing shortage is not to find on short-term quick fixes. But to work on creating a positive staff experience, building a strong employee-centric organization identity and a supportive colleague community.

This quote is perfectly suitable to start this blog. Internships indeed give a start to your journey of being an expert in your field. They prove to be an asset when you start applying for jobs after your graduation. One gets hands-on experience of what he/she learn in college.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we have a few successful Engineering, Management and Architecture graduates who have explained how internships are helpful and how one can make the most out of them and how to get an internship report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internships or live projects are an opportunity to bridge the gap between industry and academia. They help you understand the industry quickly; if you feel it is exciting, you may go ahead and continue in it or else drop and look for another opportunity. Doing multiple internships will give you more scope to experiment. They also help you kill the nervousness before landing your dream job in an MNC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;One must try to analyze the different cross functions and how they come together and work for a common goal. Make the best of this opportunity, interact with as many people as possible, because everyone has some or the other thing to offer. You will be assigned a mentor, have constant interaction even if he/she is busy, try to schedule meetings and update them regarding your work and take regular feedback from them. This is a very good chance to make yourself accustomed to the corporate culture, right from scheduling a meeting to delivering presentations, make sure you grab all the opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tushar Kamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;VJTI Mumbai&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Worked at Bharti Airtel as Project Manager&lt;br&gt;Currently pursuing MBA at Indian Institute of Management Ranchi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internship program can allow business students to gain valuable real-world skills while making connections that will help them succeed upon graduating college.

You imagine all sorts of materials, get their prices on a computer screen, but they are almost never the same on site. The price fluctuates, the colors and textures differ. Sitting in a class, you wouldnundefinedt be able to learn what to do if the excavation work stops due to some reason or the column and beam fail due to another. All these things can only be learned on the field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the best of an internship, in my opinion, firstly, the person has to have a keen eye and observe. Nobody is going to spoon-feed you. Also, not all internships give the chance to visit the sites, especially in times like these. But they can certainly teach you a lot more. They will teach you the basics of how to approach a client, or what the next first step should be when a client approaches, how to draft a contract, etc. The next is to ask questions, even if those are silly, ask because one wouldnundefinedt learn without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikita Misal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;D.Y.Patil College of Architecture, Navi Mumbai&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Currently pursuing MBA from NICMAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, an internship is an opportunity to start your bright career.

Build Your College Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media advertising and marketing have become most important for any business to grow. The same is the case with colleges. It is vital to promote your college on social networking sites through your handle, as you are the face of your college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1228&quot; src=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/college-branding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/college-branding.jpg 812w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/college-branding-300x180.jpg 300w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/college-branding-768x462.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px&quot; width=&quot;406&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;a { color: #47b2e4; }&quot;&gt;A LinkedIn handle is also a must. Keep connecting to HRs and recruiters of your industry. Moreover, do post the achievements of the college and its stakeholders, include images of various events and college infrastructure, mention the mission &amp;amp; vision statements, and past placement records as well. This will help you stay relevant in the eyes of recruiters and HRs of various organizations. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://rareminds.in/individuals/personal-branding/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://rareminds.in/individuals/personal-branding/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color&quot;&gt;Create your own brand image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Have Placement Assistance Committee:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the colleges have 300+ students in each batch. In order to place all these students, you must have a dedicated placement assistance team. This team can consist of 2 professors and 8-10 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot; style=&quot;flex-basis:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot; style=&quot;flex-basis:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1249&quot; src=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/placement-commitee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/placement-commitee.jpg 873w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/placement-commitee-300x180.jpg 300w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/placement-commitee-768x462.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These will be involved in placement-related activities.

Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Being a Training and Placement Officer, you must conduct regular and outcome-based training programs for the students. These training sessions may include anything and everything from Technical Skills to Soft Skills. It is often seen that colleges conduct these pieces of training for fourth-year students only. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://rareminds.in/colleges-university/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://rareminds.in/colleges-university/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color&quot;&gt;Check our testimonials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1252&quot; src=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/training.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/training.jpg 840w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/training-300x205.jpg 300w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/training-768x525.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px&quot; width=&quot;413&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is advised that these training programs start from the second or third term itself so that students exactly understand the practical applications of the academic syllabus and industry expectations. Do invest time and money in conducting these continuous developmental training sessions as they add much value compared to the 2 or 3 days webinars or workshops. This will help them stay ahead of the ever-increasing competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Resume building:&lt;/strong&gt; It is often seen that students copy-paste the resumes, and these resumes are forwarded to the recruiters. As a placement committee, it is crucial to ensure that each resume is unique and reflects the true self of the student. If you feel the need to seek assistance from external firms to provide resume-related assistance to the students, please do involve them. Companiesundefined HRs will always appreciate relevant, and quality resumes instead of the quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1254&quot; src=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/resume-building.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/resume-building.jpg 861w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/resume-building-300x205.jpg 300w, https://rareminds.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/resume-building-768x525.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px&quot; width=&quot;403&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you do not have students having the qualities or skills required by the company, let the company know that in advance. Just forwarding random resumes will put your college in a bad light only. This might also hamper your future collaborations with the company. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa4uJgRwcH8&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa4uJgRwcH8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color&quot;&gt;See the change that Rareminds brings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this list is not exhaustive, these are some of the must-haves in todayundefineds times.

Businesses that used to plan their digital strategies in one- or three-year increments now have to scale their campaigns in days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one European study, roughly 70% of executives from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland believe the pandemic would hasten their digital transformation. The acceleration is already visible through industries and geographies. Consider how Asian banks have seamlessly transitioned their physical networks to the internet. How healthcare providers, insurers, and retailers have embraced telehealth, self-service claims assessment, and contactless shopping and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 crisis appears to provide a peek into a potential world in which digital has become integral to all interactions, prompting both businesses and individuals to accelerate their adoption curves almost overnight. An environment in which digital platforms are the main (and, in some cases, only) means of customer interaction, and automated processes are the primary driver of productivityundefinedand the foundation of agile, open, and reliable supply chains. An environment that was adapting to seemingly regular shifts in consumer behaviour necessitates the use of agile operating methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a silver lining, it could be the lowering of barriers to improvisation and experimentation by consumers, markets, regulators, and organizations. Companies can learn and advance faster than ever before at this specific time. The way they learn from and respond to todayundefineds crisis will have a significant impact on their success in tomorrowundefineds altered environment, allowing them to maintain greater resilience and stronger relations with consumers, employees, and suppliers. Many are willing to make improvements that undefinedstickundefined is more likely to be effective during rehabilitation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to rethink your digital strategies, both those that support staff, consumers, and the wide range of stakeholders to whom companies are increasingly accountable, and those that help you prepare for a post-crisis environment. Some objects in this universe will revert to their original state, while others will be permanently altered. Playing it safe right now, as tempting as it might be, is frequently the worst choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 can trigger both short- and long-term disturbances in these areas. During the pandemic, the virus wreaked havoc on the industries with the highest overall physical proximity scores: medical care, personal care, on-site customer service, leisure and travel. Work arenas with higher physical proximity scores are more likely to be unsettled in the long run, but proximity isnundefinedt the only factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontline staff in department stores, banks, and post offices, for example, are part of the on-site customer service arena. Working in this field necessitates on-site presence and involves regular contact with strangers. Some of this work has moved to e-commerce and other digital transactions, which is a long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hotels, restaurants, airports, and entertainment venues, customer-facing employees operate. Workers in this arena deal with large groups of strangers regularly. Most leisure venues were forced to close by COVID-19 in 2020, and airports and airlines were forced to operate on a restricted basis. Longer-term, the transition to remote work and associated reductions in business travel, as well as automation in some occupations, such as food service, may reduce labour demand in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction sites, fields, residential and commercial grounds, and other open spaces all fall under the category of outdoor development and maintenance. COVID-19 had little effect because study in this arena necessitates proximity and little contacts with others, as well as taking place entirely outside. In China and India, this is the most important arena, accounting for 35 to 55 per cent of their workforces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',NULL,'2024-09-09 00:00:00','2024-09-09 21:52:14',NULL,NULL),(67,86,'How to Manage Time Effectively','&lt;div class=&quot;blog-description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before getting into managing time well and being more productive, I would like to show some&lt;br&gt;interesting facts that might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, employees work the hardest from 9 AM to 12 PM.

Plan the start time of your day, and take a mid-day break as you did in the office, and plan at what time you will get off for the day. Also, plan your workflow at the start of your day.

The problem with this solution is to avoid cluttering, stop piling papers, and get desk-scaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homes are made for relaxing, and offices are made for work. Thus the architecture of both will be different. Offices are more naturally lighted and with ambience encouraging to work. Perks of working from home can be creating a personalized space for work.

It is going to be the foundation of all your efforts, so you need to make sure that it is a strong one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers almost always use CVs to shortlist candidates before further rounds of selections. So, you have to provide a compelling argument in your CV for the recruiter to select you.

A good resume contains the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant&lt;/strong&gt; undefined It is not a good idea to make a single, standard CV and use the same for every job that you apply for. You need to be able to modify your CV every time you apply for a job and tailor it to suit the specific job requirements. It should convey why you are best qualified for that particular role. This is going to vary every time you apply for a different job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know which keywords to use&lt;/strong&gt; undefined When recruiters go through a resume, they do not read the&lt;br&gt;entire document. They look for specific keywords. Nowadays, most companies use special software to scan resumes, and they do the same undefined look for keywords. You need to know which keywords to use, and where to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coherence&lt;/strong&gt; undefined A good resume is minimalistic, but at the same time, it should form a coherent whole. It has a flow to it, and a clear story emerges out of it undefined a story of you.

However, there is always some activity, skill or domain that a person can excel at. Your task is to find that one area. However, this is easier said than done. Only a rigorous analysis of your aptitude, personality, interests, abilities, strengths and weaknesses etc. can help bring out where your true potential lies. Oftentimes it so happens that a person is not fully aware of all the options that are available and relevant to them. The usual support system of a person undefined parents, family, friends undefined who&lt;br&gt;normally guide on different matters, also come up short when it comes to career counselling because even they are not aware of all the latest industry trends and career option. There are over 12,000 different kinds of jobs out there and new ones are being created every year undefined it is difficult for any single person to keep up. And this is why professional guidance can be of immense help here. Professional counsellors can provide aptitude tests, personality tests, analyze your strengths and weaknesses and come up with a comprehensive list of career options that fit you best. They can chart out career trajectories and inform you what are the things you need to do to start and excel in a career of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Personal Brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A personal brand is the idea of you, that you communicate to the world.

This is important as more and more employers are using social media to screen candidates in the hiring process. They also use it to check on their current employees. If a recruiter searches for your name on Google and finds a well-crafted, professional online presence, it puts you head and shoulders above your competition. It can also open up interesting opportunities in the form of job interviews, internships,networking, etc., which might not have existed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing for the interviews is the final, and crucial, part of the journey. How you plan and strategize before the interview is an important determinant of your success. This may seem like an overwhelming task, especially for those with relatively lesser experience, so it is helpful to break the whole process into specific action points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to carefully analyse the job description and understand what the role entails. What are the responsibilities and tasks associated with it? Make a list of the qualifications, knowledge, skills and other requirements for the position. Find an alignment: The second list that you need to make is a list of all your qualities, skills and experience that will help you meet the job requirements. You can use this list to justify to the recruiter why you are a good fit for the role. You should also think through the responsibilities and see if it aligns with your interests and competencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the Job Description provided by the company, you can carry out your research to find out more about the role. Find out people on LinkedIn who have similar roles and see the what are the kind of experiences that they have had. Try connecting with a few of them and ask them for advice. Also, check what the culture in the organization is like and whether you will be able to fit in. Employers often consider this culture fit while making hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, research as much as possible about the company itself. Make sure to go through their website and other articles on them you can find. There are also certain websites where you can check reviews of the company by current and former employees. Find out more about the activities they do, the markets they are in, who their customers are, their competitors, the industry they are in, the hierarchy and the important people in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Interview Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on your analysis of the JD and your research, think about the possible questions that may come up during the interview. Get a clear idea of what you are going to speak, otherwise, you may end up fumbling during the interview. Some people prefer practicing their answers by speaking them aloud. If the interview is virtual, as is common nowadays, get to know the software that is going to be used and do a test run well before the interview.

My father once took me to those days through his memories and gave me a glimpse of their house filled with the laughter of his cousins and aunts, the redolence of the delicious food, the ringing of the rotary phone, and a small black and white television which was booked for Ramayana to be watched with the whole family every morning. But everything is subject to change, these huge families also transformed to a smaller size as other family members moved to different locations to explore better prospects. This cultural shift brought the new concept of nuclear families tightly bound with modern individualism. It would have been difficult to connect with people so often especially in this pandemic. Today we are stuck in the most unprecedented situation that has confined us to our homes.

Keep wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier to convey just information, we were required to write a postcard or telegram that took at least 10 days to reach its destination. Well, I cannot imagine a life like that! Where I have to wait for weeks to ask&lt;br&gt;someone. Should we catch up tomorrow? Technology has made our lives so easy that it enables us to connect to the&lt;br&gt;farthest relative just in a click. This quick medium has been the biggest relief, especially in corona times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make &amp;amp; Save Memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents and grandparents have very few photographs to show us, the cameras used back then were not so handy and the cost associated to get the photos to be printed restricted the number of clicks. Today we can&lt;br&gt;capture endless photos with our family and enjoy the moment without worrying about the reel left or the cost of getting it printed. Technology has also eliminated the issues of losing photos. We have options to save and share images through the cloud, which makes our job easy, allowing multiple family members to access the photos and save them to their personal drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Collective entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One screen with countless entertainment options satisfying the need of every person in the room has improved the experience of watching television. Back in the 90s I remember, limited movies were featured only on Saturdays and Sundays but no one ever imagined that the world will get access to such an advanced platform like OTT (Over the Top) where a gamut of movies, channels, shows, YouTube, etc. is available carefully curated for us based on our choices. Netflix identified the importance of family and friends by launching a Netflix party that enables its customers to not miss watching movies with family even being at distant locations. So the technology has turned out to be the most important factor in countering the pandemic which kept the world moving ahead and helped us to stay connected with our loved ones nurturing our traditional family values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',NULL,'2024-09-09 00:00:00','2024-09-09 21:59:06',NULL,NULL),(71,90,'How to become the Complete Architect Professional','&lt;div class=&quot;blog-description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have done it. You have endured the rigor and hardships of your challenging B. Arch program and are about to graduate. You possess complete theoretical and practical knowledge of a qualified architect. While this is a huge achievement you should be proud of, there remain some doubts undefined the unpredictability of your first job, the uncertainty of making it as a professional. Add to that the prevailing adverse economic scenario and bleak job market, and it seems doubly challenging. As an inexperienced architect fresh out of college, it is only natural for you to feel a little daunted. And that is why we have addressed your issues here, to make life easier for you. We will tell you what you need to do to become the ideal architecture professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build your Personal Brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step towards becoming a thorough professional is to invest time in developing your personal brand undefined your unique identity and voice. Your brand is a representation of who you are to other people. It is how you choose to promote yourself, your skills, experience and personality. A personal brand develops your credibility and helps prospective employers, clients and co-workers to form a favorable impression about you. Successful professionals build their brand by leveraging social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as blogging tools such as Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, etc. You can use these platforms to display your portfolio, connect with other architects and find your own authoritative voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/strong&gt; Architecture firms, HR managers and most importantly, potential clients increasingly look at a candidateundefineds online profile before meeting them for the first time to decide whether he/she is the right person for them. In this regard, a well-crafted brand strategy will create the sort of first impression that will not only get you interview shortlists but will also ensure you stand out from the competition throughout any selection&lt;br&gt;process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donundefinedt shy away from Networking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While networking is essential in any industry, it is especially important for an architect. This&lt;br&gt;is because, when clients are choosing an architect, it is not just his skills and achievements&lt;br&gt;that matter, but also recommendations and references from fellow professionals.&lt;br&gt;Networking also helps when you are looking to join a firm. Having a personal connect with&lt;br&gt;someone already working for the firm you want to apply to makes the process much easier&lt;br&gt;for you and gives a major boost to your chances of selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do you go about creating your network?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is where your personal brand comes in handy, which is why we asked you to focus on that first. Having a significant online presence will make it easier for you to reach out to other architects. LinkedIn is a great way to build connections with influential people. You can search for people who are working in your areas of interest and follow them. Your goal should be to have meaningful conversations with them. Carefully look at any content which they have posted and shared. This will give you plenty of matter based on which you start conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job interviews can be very intimidating, and so it is important to know how to approach them. Everyone knows that they have to prepare, but there has to be a method to your approach; otherwise, you will be wasting your efforts. First, research the firm and the role well. Check out their website, their social media handles&lt;br&gt;and any other articles on them. Learn what kind of projects they do, the hierarchy, important people in the firm and their culture. Look up their employees on LinkedIn and see if you have any mutual connections. This is where your networking efforts may come in handy. Then prepare your pitch. Yes, approach your interview as if it were a sales pitch, where you are selling yourself. Again, if you have already created your personal brand, this will be much easier.

This transition from teaching in classrooms to the virtual learning process has been very challenging for both the students and the teachers. Not only It is difficult to adapt to an online world, but this pandemic has also affected the teacherundefineds workload globally. As per the reports, around 67% of the teachers now feel stressed during work, and 70% reported that they were spending more time preparing for online classes than they usually did in a classroom setting. Such reports act as evidence that teachers are facing issues in maintaining their work-life balance. Earlier, Teachers used to get small breaks during a typical school day like lunch break, recess, class change, etc., but this is missing in the new normal online phase. As per research, periodic intervals during online schooling can help you stay focused on the allotted tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain breaks provide the teachers with much-needed breaks from screen time, doing physical activity, and recharging themselves.

The healthcare industry in particular had undergone a massive transformation that has created&lt;br&gt;a ripple effect on the recruitment and hiring process in the entire industry. General processes have been&lt;br&gt;modified and a new working system has been integrated. To help you navigated through this changing&lt;br&gt;dynamic, we have compiled a list of the top 5 Healthcare Recruitment and Staffing Trends that you can&lt;br&gt;expect in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Widening Job Opportunities for the Healthcare Professionals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020 was especially hard on the healthcare industry. To deal with the strain, the healthcare&lt;br&gt;industry ramped up the hiring process across the different verticals. As per Michael Page Indiaundefineds&lt;br&gt;undefinedTalent Trends 2021 Reportundefined, there will be a continued increase in hiring within hospitals as well&lt;br&gt;as further training and nurturing to retain high-potential talent. In 2021, high recruitment across&lt;br&gt;segments such as pharmaceuticals and diagnostics is expected. Active recruitment activities&lt;br&gt;would surge with 69% of healthcare professionals actively seeking other job opportunities and&lt;br&gt;another 27% passively open to new roles. Hence for job seekers, now would be a good time to&lt;br&gt;upskill yourself and look for job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Shift from Permanent to Temporary Staffing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the macroeconomic downturn caused due to Covid- 19, the healthcare sector has started&lt;br&gt;exploring the Contract Staffing option. Healthcare HRs are looking to hire employees on a&lt;br&gt;contract basis to deal with the employee shortage and the increasing workload. The Pharma&lt;br&gt;Business HRs are especially resorting to a temporal workforce for filling roles such as on-field&lt;br&gt;and remote medical representatives, workers in their manufacturing unit and counter sales&lt;br&gt;personnel to target specific geographies they deem fit. These contract jobs would be beneficial&lt;br&gt;for individuals who have an employment gap in their CV or people who would like to take a&lt;br&gt;break during Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Remuneration Increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare and Life sciences organizations have seen robust growth last year and will continue&lt;br&gt;on this tailwind this year as well. Although many organizations have rolled back on salary cuts or&lt;br&gt;given bonuses, the healthcare domain has seen the highest percentage of average salary&lt;br&gt;increase at 8%. In 2021, remuneration increases are anticipated to attract new hires across the&lt;br&gt;healthcare sector in India. The healthcare and life sciences sector will offer the highest salary&lt;br&gt;increases to new hires, estimated up to 15-25% and 15-20% respectively; more than any other&lt;br&gt;industry. Talent Retention will be at the forefront of the HRs of the healthcare field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Focus on Employee Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic had changed the perspective of job seekers and pushed them to reevaluate their&lt;br&gt;priorities. Job seekers are looking for companies that understand their emotional needs and&lt;br&gt;support them. Benefits such as medical aid, health insurance, mental health resources and&lt;br&gt;hazard pay have joined the radar of evaluation along with good remuneration for the candidates. 45% of healthcare firms have given out more than one month of bonus to retain existing talent. Worldwide, healthcare HRs are revisiting their existing benefit packages to enhance their desirability as an employer. Surveys have been an effective tool to narrow down the required benefits to shape a relevant job offer. Rareminds team of experienced recruiters are also happy to help uncover the desired benefits for an excellent job offer and liaison between the two parties..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Increased Adoption of Virtual and Remote Practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What? Remote working in the Healthcare Domain? Yes, you heard it right. The touch of&lt;br&gt;technology has tethered the healthcare space too, especially when it comes to the pre-selection&lt;br&gt;of the candidates for the interview round.

Online interviews have increased recruitment efficiency&lt;br&gt;have significantly shortened the time and cost of hiring and reduced the risk of bias.

This will make the presentation more appealing and engaging to the audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;3.

While most of the economy is run online, it becomes imperative for the companies to onboard fresh talent through online interviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;For candidates, giving an interview has been a crucial task. And this change of mode from in-person interviews to online can be intimidating for some.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;But worry not! Here are some tips and tricks to crack an online interview:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before the Interview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Research about the company&lt;/strong&gt; on LinkedIn and company website. This will help you acquaint yourself with the company and understand their expectations from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ensure that you have &lt;strong&gt;good internet connectivity&lt;/strong&gt; and a fully charged laptop/mobile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Wear the entire set of formals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; An interviewer might ask you to stand up and present on a topic. You will not want to take the risk of facing an embarrassing moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the interview&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. During an online interview, remember that the interviewer has the disadvantage of not being able to judge your body language at all. Thatundefineds why you have to make sure that you are expressive and confident through your &lt;strong&gt;facial expressions and hand gestures&lt;/strong&gt;. But also be sure not to use them too much, it will show your casual attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Be confident.&lt;/strong&gt; Have a smile on your face. Even if you do not know the answer to a particular question, do not show it on your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Take time to think.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not start answering immediately after the interviewer finishes his/her question. Take a few seconds to think and decide the structure of the answer. An interviewer will always appreciate a thoughtful and well-structured response instead of a hasty and random one. You may also ask for 30-45 seconds to think. They wonundefinedt mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Be well-read&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;about the job role&lt;/strong&gt; you have applied for and try answering most of the questions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Highlight your past work experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; wherever applicable. The interviewers can easily relate to your capabilities if you highlight your experience. This helps them judge your fitness for the role better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Towards the end of the interview:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The last and the most critical question that is commonly asked is, undefined&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any questions for us?&lt;/strong&gt;undefined DO ASK a relevant question. Ask them something related to your LinkedIn and company website research. This shows that you have done your homework and are indeed keen on the job. Trust me. It can turn tables for you! There have been instances where the candidateundefineds overall interview was average, but this one question that he/she asked made the interviewer offer the job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Do not forget to thank&lt;/strong&gt; the interviewer for his/her time before you hit that undefinedleave meetingundefined button. Doing this would not create any significant impact, but not doing so will leave a negative impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Tip 1): &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are going for an interview for the first time, make sure to give at least three mock interviews.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Tip 2): &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that the company wants to know you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; Show your willingness and knowledge to the interviewer. But also ensure that you do not talk too much.

Make a teaching resolution on how you can better yourself at a particular aspect and commit to it with a specified timeline( quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to be better at Blended Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently proposed New Education Policy by the Government has great emphasis on Blended learning, where Online/virtual learning should be incorporated to students along with on campus classes. This necessity, along with the growing popularity of online education models makes it a must for every teacher to be sufficiently skilled at online technology, gadgets, conducting webinars,etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take periodical breaks from work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a senior teacher, there is a high chance you always have more work to do. But, this might lead to stress and you running out of new ideas. Itundefineds always a good practice to take periodical breaks between your work and engage in recreational activities such as taking a vacation or catching a movie or catching up with your close friends. This will refresh your mind and will help you in being innovative and creative with your students in the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that these tips are helpful to improve/upskill yourself as a teacher.

The ability to work with changes in environments and tasks is an asset in present day scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to be tech savvy, especially when it pertains to computer knowledge and application is a quality that is expected of every budding professional.
